# Lipid Rendering Platform - Development Roadmap

## Platform Overview

The Lipid Rendering Platform is a production-ready scientific web application designed to facilitate molecular visualization and protein-ligand docking analysis. While the platform's primary focus is on lipid molecules and their interactions with immune-related proteins, it supports any molecule with a valid SMILES structure, making it a versatile tool for molecular research.

## Vision

To provide scientists with a trusted, accurate, and comprehensive platform for:
- Visualizing molecular structures in 2D and 3D
- Performing high-precision molecular docking simulations
- Analyzing immune system activation pathways
- Understanding electrostatic properties of molecules

All results must meet the highest standards of scientific accuracy, suitable for publication in peer-reviewed journals.
