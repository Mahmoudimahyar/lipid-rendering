# Lipid Viewer + Molecular Docking Project Plan

## Overview
**Goal**: Add molecular docking functionality to the existing lipid viewer application while maintaining all current functionality.

**Key Requirements**:
- Keep current React/Vite lipid viewer fully intact
- Add a new visually appealing Docking page with all lipid viewer capabilities plus docking
- Django backend for docking operations
- Maintain >50% test coverage for each phase
- Run full test suite after each change to ensure no regressions

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React/Vite SPA (existing) + new Docking page
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework with scientific computing stack
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for backend, static hosting for frontend

## Testing Strategy

### Per-Phase Requirements
1. New/modified code must have >50% test coverage
2. Full test suite must pass (no regressions)
3. Manual testing of new features

### Commands
```bash
# Frontend tests
cd lipid_viewer
npm test -- --coverage

# Backend tests (after Phase 1)
cd server
pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing

# Phase coverage check (example)
pytest --cov=api --cov-report=term-missing api/tests/
```

## Quick Reference

### Frontend Dev Server
```bash
cd lipid_viewer
npm run dev -- --host --port 3000

```

### Docker Commands (after Phase 1)
```bash
